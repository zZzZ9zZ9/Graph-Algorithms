From Professor **Yun (Eric) Liang** at Peking University, the course "**Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization for Computing Systems**"


# Attachment
- Algorithm template for graph algorithm
    - `Basic`file
    - `SCC`file
    - `Shortest path`file
    - `Minimum spanning tree`file
    - `Max flow`file

- `Graph_Algorithm.md` : Graph algorithm summary

- `cheat_sheet.md` : Graph algorithm cheat sheet
- `cheat_sheet.pdf` : Graph algorithm cheat sheet pdf(printable)


# Note
- `Graph_Algorithm.md` is a summary of graph algorithms, covering the first half of the course, which is also the main content of the midterm exam of this course

- All the content of `Graph_Algorithm.md` comes from the course "Modeling, Analysis and Optimization of Computing Systems" by Professor Yun(Eric) Liang, and is for learning and communication only.

- The algorithm template is the implementation of various parts of the algorithm, most of which come from the homework of `openjudge`. However, the code in it has been modified appropriately, even if the original question appears in the homework, the code in the template is not the correct answer. It is recommended to refer to the code to help understand, do not directly copy the code, **be sure to write it yourself to deepen the understanding.**

- During the midterm exam, you are allowed to bring a cheat sheet. `cheat_sheet.md` is the cheat sheet I prepared, and `cheat_sheet.pdf` is the pdf version of `cheat_sheet.md`, which can be printed out and brought to the exam site. If you are used to this cheat sheet, you can use it directly. If not, you can prepare a cheat sheet according to your preference, so that you can use it in the exam more conveniently.

- The exam questions are similar to the homework questions, and the key to the exam is to use the graph algorithms learned proficiently. Only one question will require some tricky techniques. As long as you are familiar with all the algorithms taught in class and can quickly write the code, you will have a good grade. **So before the exam, be sure to finish the homework independently, be familiar with the code implementation of various algorithms, and the application scenarios of various algorithms.**

- Professor Liang's lectures are truly excellent. He explains most algorithms in great detail, so even though attendance isn't required, **it's highly recommended to attend the in-person classes**. The teaching assistants during the lab sessions are also very responsible and patient, answering all questions and even helping with one-to-one debugging.

- Due to my limited abilities, there may still be many errors in the notes and algorithm templates, please bear with me. I hope these notes and algorithm templates can help you, and I also hope you gain a lot from this course and achieve a good grade. **Good luck!**
